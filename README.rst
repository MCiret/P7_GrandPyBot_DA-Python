DESCRIPTION

Learning project
----------------
This Web app has been developed during OpenClassrooms training course "Python Application Development".

**GOAL** :

* very 1st Web app using Flask framework (minimalist : 1 route, no DB, no tests)
* AJAX + HTML/CSS basics
* "Like NLP" logic/algo (option : use a third library --> SpaCy had been chosen)

    **When** GrandPy Bot answers me,

    **Then** he displays a message informing me of the address, the start of Wikipedia article and its url and the here.com marked map.

2) User asks GrandPy Bot a place name that is not locatable by here.com.

    **Given** I am a user who is asking for a place address,

    **When** GrandPy Bot answers me,

    **Then** he displays a message informing me of incapacity to locate this place.

3) User asks GrandPy Bot a place name that is locatable by here.com but do not have a Wikipedia article.

4) Environment variables to be set :

    * DEBUG --> 1 for local/dev run | 0 for prod
    * HERE_API_KEY --> API key for here.com access
